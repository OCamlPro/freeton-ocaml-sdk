The freeton_ocaml_sdk library is a binding to the TON-SDK Rust library
and the GraphQL API of the FreeTON blockchain. It can be used to build
application to query the account states, transactions and other blockchain
data. to deploy and call smart contracts.

The FreeTON blockchain is the open-source version of the Telegram Open
Network. FreeTON is one of the only blockchains with dynamic sharding
for unlimited scalability and immediate finality for real-time
applications. It also uses Proof-of-Stake with delegation through
smart contracts. Smart contracts are written in dialects of Solidity
and C++ with asynchonous external calls.
