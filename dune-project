It can be used to build\napplication to query the account states, transactions and other blockchain\ndata. to deploy and call smart contracts.\n\nThe FreeTON blockchain is the open-source version of the Telegram Open\nNetwork. FreeTON is one of the only blockchains with dynamic sharding\nfor unlimited scalability and immediate finality for real-time\napplications. It also uses Proof-of-Stake with delegation through\nsmart contracts. Smart contracts are written in dialects of Solidity\nand C++ with asynchonous external calls.\n\n")
