Quick Start
===========

Initial Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to use :code:`ft`, we will need some tools from TON-SDK
(:code:`tonos-cli`, :code:`tvm_linker`, :code:`solc` and
:code:`stdlib_sol.tvm`) to be installed in :code:`$HOME/.ft/bin/`.

For that, :code:`ft` provides a simple command that will download
their sources and build them, provided that you have a recent version
of Rust installed::

  ft init


Testing a Solidity Contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's suppose that we have a simple Free TON Solidity smart contract::

  pragma ton-solidity ^0.37.0;
  pragma AbiHeader expire;
  
  contract HelloWorld {
  
    string variable ;
    constructor(string arg) public { variable = arg ; }
    
    function get_var() public view returns (string s)
    { s = variable ; }
  }

First, let's try to compile it::

  ─➤ ft contract --build Basic.sol
  
  Calling /home/user/.ft/bin/solc Basic.sol
  Code was generated and saved to file Basic.code
  ABI was generated and saved to file Basic.abi.json
  Calling /home/user/.ft/bin/tvm_linker compile -o Basic.tvm Basic.code --abi-json Basic.abi.json --lib /home/user/.ft/bin/stdlib_sol.tvm
  TVM linker 0.1.0
  COMMIT_ID: 85973140d89b0da5c211b562be86fba5783815d1
  BUILD_DATE: 2021-03-04 16:02:46 +0100
  COMMIT_DATE: 2021-02-17 19:22:22 +0300
  GIT_BRANCH: master
  Calling cp -f Basic.sol Basic.abi.json /home/user/.ft/contracts
  Calling cp -f Basic.tvm /home/user/.ft/contracts/Basic.tvc
  Config loaded from /home/user/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/user/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json

We can see that :code:`ft` called :code:`solc` and then
:code:`tvm_linker` to compile and link the contract. The contract was
then copied in the contract database of :code:`ft` under the name
:code:`Basic` (as extracted from the filename).

We will now try to run it locally. For that, let's create a sandbox
network on the current computer::

  ╰─➤ ft switch --create sandbox1
  
  Config loaded from /home/user/.ft/config.json
  Network: mainnet
  Loading wallet file /home/user/.ft/mainnet/wallet.json
  Calling docker create --name local-node-7081 -e USER_AGREEMENT=yes -p7081:80 tonlabs/local-node
  274bcd1a5ab7190ad7cb91052b2870dce4bc301affda5eecf91a85791eb6ecde
  Saving wallet file /home/user/.ft/mainnet/wallet.json
  Saving wallet file /home/user/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  Saving config file /home/user/.ft/config.json

It is possible to create as many sandboxes as wanted, the only
constraint is for the name to start with :code:`sandbox`.

Now, let's start the node::
  
  ─➤ ft node --start
  
  Config loaded from /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/lefessan/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  Calling docker start local-node-7081
  local-node-7081

It is possible to check that the node is running using::

  ─➤ ft node --web
  
  Config loaded from /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/lefessan/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  Calling xdg-open http://0.0.0.0:7081/graphql

That command will open the browser on the GraphQL Playground page of
the server.

Now, we also have a set of preconfigured users, but we will need some
coins to be able to deploy the smart contract::

  ─➤ ft account
  
  Config loaded from /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/lefessan/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  Account "giver": 4_999_999_999.975_350 TONs
  Account "user9": not yet created
  Account "user8": not yet created
  Account "user7": not yet created
  Account "user6": not yet created
  Account "user5": not yet created
  Account "user4": not yet created
  Account "user3": not yet created
  Account "user2": not yet created
  Account "user1": not yet created
  Account "user0": not yet created

So, let's ask the giver for some coins::

  ╰─➤ ft node --give user1
  
  Config loaded from /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/lefessan/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  For key user1

  Saving config file /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json

We can now check the account of :code:`user1`::

  ╰─➤ ft account user1
  
  Config loaded from /home/lefessan/.ft/config.json
  Network: sandbox1
  Loading wallet file /home/lefessan/.ft/sandbox1/wallet.json
  Account "user1": 1_000.944_105_999 TONs

(note that we could have used :code:`ft account user1 -v` to get a
complete view of the account, with all other fields)

Now, let's deploy the contract :code:`Basic`. For that, we will create
an account :code:`basic` and call the constructor with the argument
:code:`"Hello World"`::

  ─➤ ft contract --deploy Basic --create basic --params '{ "arg": "%{hex:string:Hello World}" }'

Here, several things happened:

1. We used the :code:`--create basic` option to create a new address for the contract with a key pair, associated with the account name :code:`basic` (you can use :code:`--replace basic` to recreate an address, while keeping the same account name, for example if you changed the contract code and rebuilt it before redeploying). When the :code:`--create/replace` options are used, 1 TON is sent automatically from the deployer account (:code:`user1` by default), unless the :code:`--sign SOURCE` option is specified.

2. We used an automatic substitution in the argument. Indeed, strings values must be passed as hexa, so we used the notation :code:`%{hex:string:STRING}` to convert the :code:`STRING` to hexa. Several substitutions are available, such as :code:`{base64:file:FILENAME}` to translate the content of a file to base64. See the substitutions section for more.

3. The contract was deployed and the constructor called with the argument.

We can now call the :code:`get_var` method::

  ╰─➤ ft call basic get_var '{}'
